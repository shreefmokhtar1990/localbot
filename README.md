# ChatGPT Local Application

This project is a local application that allows a ChatGPT bot to interact with a specified path on your device. The bot can read, write, create, modify, and study files. The application is integrated with OpenAPI for API endpoint definitions and handling file uploads.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code of the application.
  - `bot/`: Integration code for the ChatGPT bot.
  - `api/`: Handles API requests, including OpenAPI specifications.
  - `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers.
  - `models/`: Data models and schemas.
  - `services/`: Business logic and service layer.
- `config/`: Contains configuration files essential for setting up and running the application.
- `public/assets/`: Stores public assets like images, stylesheets, JavaScript files.
- `docs/`: Project documentation including setup and usage instructions.
- `tests/`: Test cases and scripts for ensuring code reliability.
- `scripts/`: Scripts for database migration, setup, etc.
- `logs/`: Stores application logs.

## Important Files

- `README.md`: Project overview and setup instructions.
- `package.json`: Manages dependencies.
- `.gitignore`: Lists files to be ignored by version control.
- `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml`: For containerization.

## Special Considerations

- Local File Interaction: Module for handling local file interactions.
- OpenAPI Integration: Using OpenAPI for API endpoint definition.
- File Upload Handling: Endpoints for secure file uploads.
- Bot Communication: Handling communication with the ChatGPT API.

## Feature Implementation Steps

- Data Processing and Analysis: Utilize libraries like pandas for data manipulation.
- Web Interaction: Use requests and BeautifulSoup for web content interaction.
- File Management: API endpoints for file upload, download, and manipulation.
- Integration with ChatGPT Bot: Develop a layer for ChatGPT bot communication.
